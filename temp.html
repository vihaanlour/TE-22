        The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)​​​​​​​ in our atmosphere, as of July 2021, is the highest it has been in human history.

      <b>2020 was a scorcher</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Analysis by NOAA shows that average global temperatures in 2020 were 1.76 degrees F (0.98 degrees C) warmer than the 20th century average — making it the second-hottest year on record. In fact, the seven warmest years in the 1880-2020 record have all occurred since 2014.

    <b>11% of emissions</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Eleven percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are due to deforestation 5 — comparable to the emissions from all of the passenger vehicles on the planet.

    <b>Nature is an untapped solution</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Tropical forests are incredibly effective at storing carbon, providing at least a third of the mitigation action needed to prevent the worst climate change scenarios. Yet nature-based solutions receive only 3% of all climate funding.

    <b>Fight climate change, improve livelihoods — naturally    </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Natural climate solutions such as restoring degraded forests could create as many as 39 jobs per million dollars spent — that's a job-creation rate more than six times higher than the oil and gas industry.
