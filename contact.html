      <h2>Greta Thunberg</h2>

      <div class="text">
        Thunberg became well-known after she protested outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, when she was 15.
<Br>
She held a sign saying "School Strike for Climate", to pressure the government to meet carbon emissions targets.
<Br>
Her small campaign had a global effect, inspiring thousands of young people across the world to organise their own strikes.
<Br>
By December 2018, more than 20,000 students - from the UK to Japan - had joined her by skipping school to protest.
<Br>
A year later, she received the first of three Nobel Peace Prize nominations for climate activism. </p>

  <h2>Melanie Downer</h2>

      Meet Melanie Downer. The 21-year-old got her start in environmental conservation by simply being a curious kid from St. John’s, Nfld.
        <br>
        She wanted to know “why we know the things we know” when it came to the beautiful ocean life on display near her home — saying we know more about Mars than the bottom of the ocean in many regards.
              <br>
              She asked the question: how can we be more sustainable when it comes to our oceans?
         <br>
        That led her to Memorial University where she is researching her undergraduate honours thesis on microplastic pollution in ocean sentiments.
         <br>
        Downer is also spearheading the Ocean Bridge Ambassador Program — a rural community initiative just outside of St. John’s where people can learn about the ocean and what lurks under the surface.
